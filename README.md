# Game-of-Life
Game of life is a cellular automata developed by the late John Conway. After several generations, it creates interesting and seemingly complex patterns, although it is a fully deterministic game as it's evolution can be determined by it's initial state using the floowing 3 rules -
  
  1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
  2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
  3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
